          Durga Puja also celebrated as Navratri or Dussehra festival is an
          annual Hindu festival originating in the Indian subcontinent which
          reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess Durga and is also
          celebrated because of the victory of goddess Durga in her battle
          against the shape-shifting Asura, Mahishasura.
